How to check if line intersects circle?

ax + by = c -> formula for linear equation

X^2 + Y^2 = C -> formula for circle

X^2 + Y^2 <= C -> formula for solid (shaded in) circle

if at ANY point in the line x^2 + y^2 <= C then intersect

so ax+by=c and x^2 + y^2 <= C -> 2 simultaneous equations

if a, b, c, C are constants, how to evaluate (x^2 + y^2 <= C)?

hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
---Tangent time (not the o/a trig tangent)---

How to check intersection point(s) of 2 lines, if any?

simultaneous equations duh

then I can do the substitution
there were 3 methods right (elimination, substitution, smth) i forgot the third one :skull:

How to find shortest distance from line AB and point (x, y)?

If I define line CD as a line that's the shortest distance between line AB and the point, line CD will be perpendicular to the line AB

ok im back (24/03/2023)
so to find the area of a triangle with the coordinates of the points you can use the "Heron's Formula"
turns out heron 's formula is just with the side lengths

so anyway
you can find the shortest distance from line AB and point C via this method:
1. create triangle ABC and find area of triangle ABC using Heron's formula
2. shortest distance of AB from C will be perpendicular to AB. Thus we can find the distance with the reverse of the 0.5*legth*height formula: 2*(area/AB)
done

27/03 im in chinese class rn

so if I were to program this or smth
